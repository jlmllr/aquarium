# Imagine you have to write a (very simple) bookkeepingsystem for a bank that keeps track
# of the account balances of each of its customers

# 1. Write a function that spans a dictionary holding a default balance of 0 for an initial list of customers
# For simplicity, assume customer names are unique identifier
# (optional) Can you express that same functionality using a lambda function?

customers = {'customer1': 0, 'customer2': 0, 'customer3': 0, 'customer4': 0, 'customer5': 0, 'customer6': 0}

# 2. What are elegant ways to add or remove single and multiple customers using the functionality of dict?

customers.update({'newcustomer1': 0, 'newcustomer2': 0, 'newcustomer3': 0})
customers.pop('customer1')          # or for multiple customers
keys = ('customer2', 'customer3')
for key in keys:
    customers.pop(key, None)

# 3. Now write two simple functions that allow you to deposit and withdraw money for a given bank customer
# 4. Include error messages for inputs that are not permissible
# e.g., withdrawing negative amounts or overdrawing the account, etc.

deposit = int(input('Please enter the amount of money you want to deposit: '))
if deposit < 0:
    print('You can not deposit negative amounts of money.')
elif deposit >= 5000:
    print('You can not deposit more than 5000 Euros at a time.')
else:
    newsum = customers['customer4'] = + deposit
    if newsum < 0:
        print('The amount of money in your account is '+ str(newsum))
        print('Your bank account is in the red')
    else:
        print('The amount of money in your bank account is ' + str(newsum))


withdraw = int(input('Please enter the amount of money you want to withdraw: '))
if withdraw <= 0:
    print('You can not withdraw negative amounts of money.')
elif withdraw >= 5000:
    print('You can not withdraw more than 5000 Euros at a time')
else:
    newsum2 = customers['customer5'] = - withdraw
    if newsum2 < 0:
        print('The amount of money in your account is '+ str(newsum2))
        print('Your bank account is in the red')
    else:
        print('The amount of money in your bank account is ' + str(newsum2))

print(customers)
